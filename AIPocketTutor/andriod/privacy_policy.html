<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 19, 2026</p>
<p><strong>AI PocketTutor</strong> ("the App") is developed and maintained by BitSprouts ("we", "us", or "our"). This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>

<h2>Information You Provide (Optional)</h2>
<p>When generating a Certificate of Completion, you may optionally provide:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Used to personalize your certificate. Stored only on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Email address:</strong> Entered manually or retrieved via optional Google Sign-In. Used only to display on your certificate. Stored only on your device and never transmitted to any server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both fields are entirely optional and under your control. No account is created.</p>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>AI PocketTutor is designed with your privacy in mind. The App:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> track your location</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> use analytics or tracking services</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> use cookies</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> require account creation or login</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> store any data on external servers</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> share any data with third parties beyond what is required for Google Play Billing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
<p>The App stores the following data <strong>only on your device</strong> using Android SharedPreferences and local files:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reading progress:</strong> Which chapters you have visited in each module, so you can track and resume your progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> Your bookmarked chapter in each module.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase status:</strong> Whether you have unlocked full access, protected with integrity verification.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading streak:</strong> Your daily reading streak count, reading dates, and milestone achievements.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading schedule:</strong> Your preferred reading time, daily goal duration, and today's accumulated reading time.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate data:</strong> Your name, email (if provided), and generated certificate PDF (stored locally only).</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is never transmitted off your device. You can clear it at any time by using the "Reset Progress" button in the App or by clearing the App's data in your device settings.</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>AI PocketTutor offers a one-time in-app purchase to unlock all content. This transaction is processed entirely by <strong>Google Play</strong>. We do not have access to your payment information (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.). Google's handling of your payment data is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The third-party services used by the App are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Billing Library:</strong> Used solely to process the one-time in-app purchase. No other payment or financial data is handled by the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In (optional):</strong> Used only within the Certificate of Completion dialog to retrieve your email address. No account is created, and no data is sent to our servers. Google's handling of sign-in data is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>No analytics tools, advertising frameworks, or other third-party SDKs are included.</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>The App may request permission to send local notifications for daily reading reminders. These notifications are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Entirely optional — you choose whether to enable them</li>
    <li>Generated locally on your device using Android's AlarmManager</li>
    <li>Not connected to any remote push notification service</li>
    <li>Can be disabled at any time from the App's reading schedule settings or your device's notification settings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Certificate of Completion</h2>
<p>When you generate a Certificate of Completion, the App:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Asks for your name and email address (entered manually or via optional Google Sign-In) to personalize the certificate</li>
    <li>Stores your name and email <strong>only on your device</strong> in SharedPreferences</li>
    <li>Generates a PDF certificate stored locally in the App's private file directory</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not</strong> transmit your name, email, or certificate to any server</li>
    <li>Allows you to share or download the certificate using your device's standard sharing features</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>AI PocketTutor is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
